## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an assistant professor at [UGA](https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr) since 2005 and a [Debian Developper](https://nm.debian.org/person/vdanjean/) since 2006 where I maintain [a few packages](https://qa.debian.org/developer.php?login=vdanjean@debian.org).

My work at university involves teaching algorithmics, programming languages, architecture, parallel programming, operating system, etc.
